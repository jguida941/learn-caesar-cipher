# Security Policy

While this project is primarily educational, please report any security concerns privately first so we can patch them before disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: `security@jguida.dev`
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions (scripts or CLI), and any suggested fixes.
- You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours.
- We aim to publish fixes and advisories within 14 days.

## Supported Versions

| Version            | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Educational scripts (`src/`) | ✓
| CLI package (`caesar-cli`)   | ✓

If a vulnerability affects downstream learners, we will update both code paths and the documentation.
